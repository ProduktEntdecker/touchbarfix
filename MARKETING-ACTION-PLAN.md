Target subreddits:
- r/MacBookPro (120k members)
- r/Mac (2.8M members)
- r/macOS (380k members)
- r/applehelp (550k members)

**Approach:**
```
Title: "My Touch Bar keeps freezing on Sonoma - found this simple fix"
Content: Share genuine experience, mention the Terminal command,
casually mention you made an app for convenience
```

#### 2. SEO Content (Week 2-3)
Create blog posts:
- "Touch Bar Not Working on macOS Sonoma? Here's Every Fix"
- "Why Does the Touch Bar Freeze? Technical Deep Dive"
- "Touch Bar vs Function Keys: The Complete History"

#### 3. YouTube Strategy (Week 3-4)
- Create "How to Fix Touch Bar" tutorial
- Show Terminal method first
- Mention app as convenience option
- Target keywords: "touch bar not working", "fix touch bar macOS"

### B. Paid Acquisition (Month 2)

#### 1. Google Ads
- Target: "touch bar frozen", "touch bar not working"
- Budget: €100/month test
- Expected CPA: €2-3

#### 2. Reddit Ads
- Target: r/MacBookPro, r/macOS
- Budget: €50/month

5. **Developer Credibility** (LinkedIn, GitHub profile)

### B. Reduce Friction:
1. **Multiple Payment Options**:
   - Gumroad (current)
   - Paddle (better for EU)
   - Crypto option (tech audience)

2. **Try Before Buy**:
   - Homebrew cask (trial)
   - 7-day trial via website
   - Demo video

### C. Social Proof Acceleration:
1. **Early User Program**:
