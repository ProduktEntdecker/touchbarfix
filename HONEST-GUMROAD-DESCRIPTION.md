# TouchBarFix - Simple Touch Bar Restart Utility

## What This Tool Does

TouchBarFix is a basic menu bar utility that restarts your MacBook's Touch Bar when it freezes or becomes unresponsive. 

It's essentially a convenient graphical interface for Terminal commands that restart the Touch Bar process.

## How It Works

1. Click the TouchBarFix icon in your menu bar
2. Select "Restart Touch Bar" 
3. Wait a few seconds for the Touch Bar to reinitialize

That's it. It's a simple tool that does one specific thing.

## What It Can Fix

✅ Touch Bar showing black screen
✅ Touch Bar not responding to touches  
✅ Touch Bar buttons stuck or frozen
✅ Unresponsive ESC key on Touch Bar

## Important Limitations

❌ **Cannot fix hardware problems** - If your Touch Bar is physically damaged, this won't help
❌ **Not a prevention tool** - It doesn't stop Touch Bar issues from happening
❌ **Not a permanent fix** - If you have hardware issues, the problem will return

## Free Alternative

You can achieve the same result using these Terminal commands:
```
pkill TouchBarServer
killall ControlStrip
```

TouchBarFix simply provides a menu bar interface for these commands. If you're comfortable with Terminal, you don't need this tool.

## System Requirements

- MacBook Pro with Touch Bar (2016-2020 models)
- macOS 10.14 or later
- macOS user account
- 5MB free disk space

## Why €2.99?

This is a convenience fee for users who prefer clicking a menu bar icon over typing Terminal commands. The price reflects the simple nature of the tool - it's not a complex application, just a user-friendly interface for system commands.
