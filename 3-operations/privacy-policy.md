# TouchBarFix Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: August 21, 2025**

## Data Collection & Privacy

TouchBarFix is designed with privacy first. We collect minimal, anonymized data to improve the app experience while respecting your privacy.

### What We Collect
- **Fix Success Data**: Whether TouchBar restart succeeded or failed
- **Device Model**: Only MacBook model series (e.g., "MacBookPro15") - no serial numbers or personal identifiers
- **Timestamp**: When fixes were attempted (for reliability statistics)
- **App Version**: TouchBarFix version for compatibility tracking

### What We DON'T Collect
- Personal information (names, emails, etc.)
- Location data
- IP addresses (not stored server-side)
- MacBook serial numbers
- Any files or personal data on your device
- Browsing history or other app usage

### How Data Is Used
- **App Improvement**: Fix success rates help us improve TouchBarFix
- **Social Proof**: Anonymous aggregate statistics (e.g., "10,000+ successful fixes")
- **Bug Tracking**: Identify and fix compatibility issues

### Data Sharing
We do NOT:
- Sell your data to third parties
- Share data with advertisers
- Use data for marketing outside our own app

We only share aggregated, anonymous statistics publicly (like total fix counts).

### Your Control
- All data collection can be disabled in app settings
- No account required - app works completely offline if preferred
- Delete analytics data anytime by reinstalling the app

### Analytics API
- Data sent via encrypted HTTPS
- No cross-site tracking
- Server logs automatically deleted after 90 days
