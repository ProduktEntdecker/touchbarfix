Hey r/macapps!

Like many of you, I've dealt with the infamous frozen Touch Bar issue on my MacBook Pro. When Apple quoted me €700 for a "hardware replacement" for what's clearly a software issue, I decided to solve it myself.

**What TouchBarFix does:**
- Instantly recovers frozen/unresponsive Touch Bar (literally 3 seconds)
- Prevents future freezes with smart monitoring
- Works on all Touch Bar MacBooks (2016-2020)
- Zero configuration needed - just click and it works

**The problem it solves:**
The Touch Bar freezing is almost always a software issue with the Touch Bar agent process, not a hardware failure. Apple's solution? Replace the entire top case for €700+. My solution? A simple app that costs less than a coffee.

**Launch offer:**
To celebrate the launch, I'm offering 50% off for the next 48 hours.
- Regular price: €13.99
- Launch price: €6.99
- Use code: REDDIT50

**Download:** [gumroad.com/l/touchbarfix](https://gumroad.com/l/touchbarfix)

The app is fully notarized by Apple and includes a 30-day money-back guarantee if it doesn't solve your Touch Bar issues.

Happy to answer any questions about the app or the Touch Bar issue in general!

**Edit:** Wow, thanks for all the support! For those asking, yes it works with the ESC key issue too.

PSA: You don't need to pay Apple €700 to fix your frozen Touch Bar - here's the €7 solution that actually works
```

**Body:**
```
If you're like me and have been living with a frozen/glitchy Touch Bar because you refuse to pay Apple's ridiculous €700 repair fee, I have good news.

The Touch Bar freezing is a software issue 99% of the time. The Touch Bar agent process crashes and doesn't recover properly. Apple knows this, but they'll still quote you for a full hardware replacement.

I built TouchBarFix to solve this permanently. It:
- Recovers your Touch Bar in 3 seconds
- Runs in the background to prevent future freezes
- Uses official macOS APIs (fully notarized)

I've been using it for months, and my Touch Bar hasn't frozen once since. 

Currently doing a launch sale at €6.99 (normally €13.99): [gumroad.com/l/touchbarfix](https://gumroad.com/l/touchbarfix)

Includes 30-day refund if it doesn't work for you (though it's worked for everyone so far).

Hope this helps someone avoid that insane repair cost!

My Touch Bar repair journey: From €700 Apple quote to building my own €7 solution
```

**Body:**
```
**The Problem:**
My 2019 MacBook Pro's Touch Bar started freezing randomly. Sometimes black screen, sometimes stuck buttons, sometimes completely unresponsive.

**Apple's Solution:**
Genius Bar ran diagnostics, found "no hardware issues" but still quoted €700 for top case replacement because "that's the only way to fix Touch Bar issues."

**The Research:**
Spent weeks researching. Found thousands of people with the same issue. Discovered it's almost always the TouchBarAgent process crashing, not hardware failure.

**The Solution:**
Built TouchBarFix - a simple menu bar app that:
1. Monitors Touch Bar health
2. Instantly recovers when frozen (3 seconds)
3. Prevents future crashes

**The Result:**
Been using it for 3 months. Zero Touch Bar issues since. Saved €700.

**Sharing the Solution:**
Made it available for others facing the same problem: [gumroad.com/l/touchbarfix](https://gumroad.com/l/touchbarfix)

Currently €6.99 (launch week special). Includes 30-day guarantee.

Sometimes the best solutions come from frustration with the status quo.

## Hacker News (When Ready)

```
Show HN: TouchBarFix – A €7 alternative to Apple's €700 Touch Bar repair
```

**Body:**
```
Hi HN! I built TouchBarFix after Apple quoted me €700 to fix what turned out to be a simple software issue with my MacBook's Touch Bar.

The problem: The Touch Bar agent process crashes and doesn't recover properly, leaving the Touch Bar frozen or black. Apple's only solution is hardware replacement.

My solution: A lightweight menu bar app that monitors and instantly recovers the Touch Bar when it freezes. It's been working perfectly for me and beta testers for months.

Technical details:
- Written in Swift using official macOS APIs
- Monitors com.apple.touchbar.agent process
- Gracefully restarts Touch Bar services when needed
- Universal binary (Intel + Apple Silicon)
- Fully sandboxed and notarized

Available on Gumroad for €6.99: gumroad.com/l/touchbarfix

Source isn't open (yet) but happy to discuss the technical approach. The Touch Bar issues are fascinating from an engineering perspective - it's essentially a separate iOS device running on your Mac that sometimes loses communication with the main system.

Would love feedback from the HN community!

When Apple quoted me €700 to fix my MacBook Pro's frozen Touch Bar, I knew there had to be a better way.
