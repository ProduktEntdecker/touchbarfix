**Solution Positioning:**
"TouchBarFix restarts the Touch Bar processes in 30 seconds. What Apple charges €700 for, we fix instantly."

**Founders Edition Hook:**
"While we wait for Apple's certification process (24-48 hours), get TouchBarFix FREE. After certification, it's €0.99 for early adopters, then €6.99 regular price."

Title: [Free Mac App] Fixed my frozen Touch Bar - sharing for 48 hours during Apple certification

My MacBook Pro Touch Bar kept going black after waking from sleep. Apple quoted €700 for "hardware replacement" but it turned out to be a software issue.

Built a simple app that restarts the Touch Bar processes without Terminal commands. It's FREE for the next 48 hours while waiting for Apple Developer certification.

If your Touch Bar is:
❌ Completely black/blank
❌ Frozen and unresponsive  
❌ Missing function keys
❌ Glitchy after macOS updates

This might help: touchbarfix.com

After certification it'll cost €0.99 (early bird) then €6.99, but right now it's free for founders.

Works on all Touch Bar MacBooks (2016-2021), both Intel and Apple Silicon.
```

**Engagement Strategy:**
- Reply to comments quickly and helpfully
- Share technical details when asked
- Be humble about the solution
- Acknowledge it doesn't fix hardware issues

### **Phase 2: HackerNews Launch (45 minutes)**

**Post Template:**
```
Show HN: TouchBarFix – Free Mac utility to restart frozen Touch Bar (48h only)

https://touchbarfix.com

Sharing a simple utility I built to fix my MacBook Pro's Touch Bar issues. It restarts the Touch Bar processes without requiring Terminal commands or system reboots.

Offering it free for 48 hours while waiting for Apple Developer certification. After that, it'll be €0.99 for early adopters.

Built with Swift, universal binary, handles the common software issues that cause Touch Bar problems (black screen, frozen controls, unresponsive after sleep).

Not a replacement for hardware failures, but solves the majority of Touch Bar frustrations that Apple typically quotes €700+ to "fix."

Feedback welcome!
```

### **Phase 3: Twitter/X Launch (60 minutes)**

**Thread Template:**
```
🧵 Built a Mac app to fix frozen Touch Bar issues

Your MacBook Pro Touch Bar goes black → Apple says "€700 hardware replacement" → It's usually just software 🤦‍♂️

Made TouchBarFix to restart Touch Bar processes in one click. No Terminal, no reboot needed.

FREE for 48 hours: touchbarfix.com 1/7

2/ The Problem:
Touch Bar randomly goes black, freezes, or becomes unresponsive. Especially after:
• Waking from sleep
• macOS updates  
• Connecting/disconnecting external monitors
• Random Tuesday mornings 😅

3/ Apple's "Solution":
"That'll be €700 for a hardware replacement, 3-5 business days"

Actual solution: Restart TouchBarServer process 🙄

4/ What TouchBarFix does:
• Detects your MacBook model
• Safely restarts Touch Bar processes
• Works in 30 seconds
• No Terminal knowledge required
• Universal binary (Intel + Apple Silicon)

5/ Why FREE right now:
Waiting for Apple Developer certification (24-48 hours)
After that: €0.99 early bird → €6.99 regular
Figured I'd share with fellow frustrated Mac users 🤝

6/ Download: touchbarfix.com
Works on MacBook Pro 2016-2021 with Touch Bar
⚠️ Can't fix actual hardware failures, but ~95% of Touch Bar issues are software

7/ Would love feedback from the Mac community! 
RT if you've been frustrated by Touch Bar issues 🔄

## 🗣️ COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY

### **Response Templates:**

**Technical Questions:**
"TouchBarFix safely restarts these processes: TouchBarServer, ControlStrip, NowPlayingTouchUI, TouchBarAgent, TouchBarUserDevice. It's the same as running pkill commands manually but with safety validation."

**Skepticism About Free:**
"It's free because I'm waiting for Apple Developer certification. Want to get feedback from real users before the paid launch. Think of it as founder beta access!"

**Comparison to BetterTouchTool:**
"BetterTouchTool is for customization, TouchBarFix is for fixing. Different use cases - BTT is great if your Touch Bar works, TouchBarFix gets it working again."

**Hardware vs Software:**
"This only fixes software issues (~95% of Touch Bar problems). If your Touch Bar has physical damage or dead pixels, you'll need Apple's repair. But try this first - might save you €700!"

### **Engagement Best Practices:**
- Be helpful, not salesy
- Admit limitations honestly
- Share technical details when asked
- Thank people for feedback
- Pin launch comment in threads
