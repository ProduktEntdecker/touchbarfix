# Touch Bar Restarter

A macOS utility that restarts the Touch Bar (`TouchBarServer` and `ControlStrip`) in one click — no Terminal or reboot needed.

## Why?

Many MacBook Pros (2016–2021) experience flickering or non-responsive Touch Bars. The usual fix requires either a Terminal command or a full system reboot. This app does it with a single click.

## Features (MVP)

- One-click Touch Bar restart
- Menu bar interface
- Lightweight and sandbox-friendly
- Signed and notarized for secure installation

## Planned Features

- Auto-restart detection
- Logging
- Preferences and update options

## Tech Stack

- SwiftUI + Xcode (macOS 12+)
- Gumroad for distribution
- Sparkle for auto-updates (non-App Store)
- Astro for landing page
- Buttondown for email capture
