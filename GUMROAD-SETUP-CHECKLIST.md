# TouchBarFix - Touch Bar Restart Utility

Restart frozen Touch Bar processes with one click on your MacBook Pro.

## What TouchBarFix Does

TouchBarFix restarts Touch Bar processes when they freeze or become unresponsive. Launch the app when your Touch Bar shows a black screen or stops responding to touches.

**Simple process:**
1. Launch TouchBarFix.app from Applications
2. Enter admin password when prompted
3. Touch Bar restarts automatically

## What's Included

✅ TouchBarFix.app (Universal Binary for Intel & Apple Silicon)
✅ Works on all MacBook Pro models with Touch Bar (2016-2020)  
✅ Lifetime updates for compatibility
✅ Email support

## System Requirements

- MacBook Pro with Touch Bar (2016-2020 models)
- macOS 10.14 (Mojave) or later
- Administrator privileges
- 5MB free disk space

## Important Limitations

**TouchBarFix only fixes software-related Touch Bar freezing.** If your Touch Bar has physical damage or hardware failure, this tool won't help.

## Free Alternative

You can achieve the same result using Terminal:
```
sudo pkill TouchBarServer
```

TouchBarFix provides a convenient app interface for this command. If you're comfortable with Terminal, you don't need this tool.

## Support & Refunds

- Full support at touchbarfix.com/support
- 30-day money-back guarantee if it doesn't work as described
- Response time: 24-48 hours
