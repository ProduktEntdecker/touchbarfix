**Title:**
```
TouchBarFix - Touch Bar restart utility for frozen MacBook Pros (€2.99)
```

**Body:**
```
I built TouchBarFix to restart frozen Touch Bar processes on MacBook Pro.

**What it does:**
- Restarts Touch Bar when it freezes or shows black screen
- One-click alternative to Terminal commands
- Works on MacBook Pro 2016-2020 models

**How it works:**
1. Launch TouchBarFix.app
2. TouchBarFix restarts the Touch Bar processes (no password required)
3. Touch Bar restarts automatically

**Terminal alternative:**
You can do the same for free with: `pkill TouchBarServer`

TouchBarFix is just a convenient app interface for this command.

**Pricing:** €2.99 (convenience fee for GUI vs Terminal)

**When it helps:**
- Touch Bar showing black screen
- Touch Bar not responding to touches
- Frozen ESC key or function buttons

**When it doesn't help:**
- Hardware damage (physical issues)
- Water damage
- Genuine hardware failure

**Note:** If TouchBarFix doesn't solve your issue, you likely need Apple hardware repair. This only fixes software-related freezing.

Happy to answer questions about Touch Bar issues.

**Team:** Created by Dr. Florian Steiner (AI Product Manager) with technical implementation by Claude Code and our specialist agent team.
