# Content Marketer Brief - TouchBarFix
## Authentic Brand Storytelling Guidelines

**Project**: TouchBarFix Content Marketing  
**Brief Date**: August 23, 2025  
**Required Reading**: `BRAND-CONTENT-GUIDELINES.md`

---

## 🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW

You're creating content marketing for TouchBarFix, a simple macOS utility that restarts frozen TouchBars. This is a **transparency-first brand** where authenticity and honesty are core values.

**Key Principle**: We provide genuine value first, mention the product second, and never exaggerate or invent stories.

---

## 🚫 CRITICAL: WHAT YOU MUST NEVER DO

### ❌ **NEVER INVENT THESE STORIES:**
- **NO €700 Apple repair quotes** (this never happened to the founder)
- **NO dramatic emergency scenarios** (TouchBar issues are minor inconveniences)
- **NO "before I became a product manager" expert positioning** (founder is learning, not teaching)
- **NO false testimonials or social proof**
- **NO exaggerated market size or problem severity**

### 🚨 **IF YOU SEE THESE IN CONTENT, STOP IMMEDIATELY:**
1. Any mention of expensive Apple repairs that "almost happened"
2. Positioning founder as TouchBar expert vs fellow learner
3. Dramatic language about "critical productivity issues"
4. Invented user quotes or success stories
5. Claims about saving "thousands" of users

---

## ✅ THE AUTHENTIC STORY (USE THIS)

### **The Real Founder Journey:**
1. **The Problem**: TouchBar occasionally goes black/frozen (minor annoyance)
2. **The Pattern**: Had to Google "TouchBar restart terminal command" repeatedly
3. **The Frustration**: Got tired of search→copy→paste cycle
4. **The Plan**: "I'll build a simple button for this. Should take 3 hours."
5. **The Reality**: 3-hour project became 7-day macOS development education
6. **The Learning**: Discovered complexity of code signing, notarization, distribution
7. **The Product**: Working app that automates `sudo killall ControlStrip` commands

### **Key Authentic Details:**
- Used AI assistance (Claude Code) for development
- Skipped traditional lean startup user interviews (admits this gap)
- Relied on Reddit comments for market validation
- Transparent about charging €2.99 for convenience, not necessity
- Always mentions free Terminal alternative exists

---

## 🎨 BRAND VOICE & VALUES

### **Brand Personality:**
- **Intelligent**: Technical competence without complexity
- **Honest**: Transparent about limitations and alternatives
- **Humble**: Learning journey, not expert teaching
- **Helpful**: Genuine value regardless of purchase decision
- **Efficient**: Focus on practical problem-solving

### **Tone Guidelines:**
- **Conversational but professional** (not casual, not corporate)
- **Technically accurate but accessible** (explain without jargon)
- **Humble about expertise** ("here's what I learned" vs "as an expert")
- **Transparent about motives** (convenience fee, not life-changing solution)
