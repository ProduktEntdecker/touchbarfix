## Additional Details (Full Description)

### What TouchBarFix Does
TouchBarFix is a simple macOS utility that restarts your Touch Bar when it freezes or becomes unresponsive. It runs the same terminal commands you could type yourself - just more conveniently.

### How It Works
1. Download and open TouchBarFix.app
2. Click "Fix Touch Bar" when your Touch Bar is frozen
3. Your Touch Bar restarts in 2-3 seconds
That's it. No complex setup, no password required.

### What Problems It Solves
✅ Black or frozen Touch Bar screen
✅ Touch Bar not responding to touches
✅ Stuck or unresponsive Touch Bar buttons
✅ ESC key not working on Touch Bar

### Important Limitations
❌ Cannot fix hardware damage or physical Touch Bar failures
❌ Not a prevention tool - doesn't stop issues from recurring
❌ Won't help if you have persistent hardware problems

### The Honest Alternative
You can achieve the same result for free using Terminal:
```
pkill TouchBarServer
killall ControlStrip
```
TouchBarFix simply provides a button interface for these commands. We charge €2.99 for the convenience of not having to remember or type Terminal commands.
