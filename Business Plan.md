# 📈 Business Plan – TouchBarFix

## 1. Executive Summary

**TouchBarFix** is a macOS menu bar app that solves the most common software issue found on MacBook Pro Touch Bars (2016–2020): the bar randomly goes black, freezes, or becomes unresponsive. The tool enables a one-click restart of the relevant macOS processes, with no technical skills or terminal needed. TouchBarFix is positioned as a utility for frustrated Mac users looking for a simple, reliable fix. Monetization is planned via a one-time purchase (€7) through Gumroad and the Mac App Store.
