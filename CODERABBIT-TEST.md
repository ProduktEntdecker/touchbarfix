# CodeRabbit Integration Test

This file tests CodeRabbit's integration with the TouchBarFix repository.

## Test Scenarios:

### 1. Version Consistency Check
- Current version: v1.2.1
- This should be checked across all files

### 2. Security Review
- Touch Bar process management
- Code signing validation  

### 3. Quality Gates
- No hardcoded dates (like 2024 in copyright)
- Valid support URLs
- Swift best practices

### 4. Custom Focus Areas
- macOS app security
- Touch Bar safety
- Distribution readiness

**Expected CodeRabbit Behavior:**
- Review this markdown file
- Apply TouchBarFix-specific prompts
- Check for issues in the overall PR context
- Provide Swift/macOS specific feedback

**Test Date:** 2024-08-20 (intentional hardcoded date to trigger quality gate)
