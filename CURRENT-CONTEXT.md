# Current Context - TouchBarFix Project

## Last Session: August 23, 2025

### Completed This Session:
- ✅ **PRO-40**: Created LinkedIn article (but found it violated brand guidelines)
- ✅ **Analysis**: Identified that LinkedIn isn't optimal channel for EMMA persona
- ✅ **Solutions**: Proposed SEO blog approach instead, created Linear issues
- ✅ **Claude Memory**: Updated CLAUDE.md with mandatory startup protocol for new instances

### Currently In Progress:
- **Blog Strategy**: Need to create Linear issues for SEO blog implementation
- **Claude Memory Solution**: Systematic approach to session handoffs

### Next Priority:
1. **Create Linear Issues**: Blog system and Claude memory solutions (copy-paste from analysis above)
2. **Blog Implementation**: Start with SEO-focused blog infrastructure
3. **Content Creation**: Write first 3 blog posts targeting EMMA's search behavior

### Current Git Status:
- **Branch**: `fix/coderabbit-feedback-august-23`
- **Status**: Working directory clean
- **Recent Changes**: Updated CLAUDE.md with startup protocol

### Active Linear Tasks:
- **PRO-40**: Marked as Done (but needs pivot to blog approach)
- **Check with**: `node linear-bridge.js list` for current status

### Key Insights from This Session:
- **EMMA Persona**: 28-40, creative/office professional, searches Google for TouchBar fixes
- **LinkedIn Reality**: Not optimal channel - EMMA doesn't search LinkedIn for tech fixes
- **Better Strategy**: SEO blog posts targeting "MacBook TouchBar not working" searches
- **Claude Memory**: Linear integration is best solution, plus mandatory startup routine

### Important Decisions Made:
- Skip LinkedIn articles, focus on SEO blog content
- Prioritize blog infrastructure and content creation
- Implement systematic Claude session handoffs
- Make Linear task checking mandatory for all new sessions
